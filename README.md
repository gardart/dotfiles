* `,b` restricts ctrlp.vim to open buffers
* `ds`/`cs` delete/change surrounding characters (e.g. `"Hey!"` + `ds"` = `Hey!`, `"Hey!"` + `cs"'` = `'Hey!'`) with [vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)
* `gcc` toggles current line comment
* `gc` toggles visual selection comment lines
* `vii`/`vai` visually select *in* or *around* the cursor's indent
* `Vp`/`vp` replaces visual selection with default register *without* yanking selected text (works with any visual selection)
