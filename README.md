# Installation


```
$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:gardart/minidot.git ~/.dotfiles
$ ~/.dotfiles/install.bash
```

Note: Although the install script will back up your own existing dotfiles, please be sure to back up your files appropriately before installation if there's anything important that already exists.
